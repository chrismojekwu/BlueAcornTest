# Blue Acorn Shopify / FE Skills Test
Chris Mojekwu - May 2021

This test was pretty challengin but I feel better after completion. The initial setup and getting data from the collections object was the most difficult part for me. It felt great to get a response and get moving however. I appreciate the opportunity and have a new found passion in Liquid.
