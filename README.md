# Blue Acorn Shopify / FE Skills Test
Chris Mojekwu - May 2021

This test was pretty challenging but I feel a lot better after completion. The initial setup and getting data from the collections object was the most difficult part for me. It felt great to get a response and get moving however. I really appreciate the opportunity and have a new found passion in Liquid. My Css is in the "assets/featuredProducts.scss.liquid", and the rest of my code is in the "sections/featured-products.liquid" file.
